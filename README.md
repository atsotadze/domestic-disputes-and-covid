I attempt to analyze how new COVID-19 cases affect domestic dispute calls in certain US Cities.

Summary 

In this project I will look to conduct analysis on the effects of 
COVID-19 on domestic disputes in US Cities. As COVID-19 cases surged 
across the US, stay-at-home orders were put in place. Schools closed, 
and many workers were furloughed, laid off, or told to work from home. 
With personal movement limited and people confined to their homes, many 
advocates became increasingly concerned about potential significant increases 
in all forms of domestic disputes. Stay-at-home orders, intended to protect the public 
and prevent widespread infection, left many victims of domestic violence 
trapped with their abusers. Reflecting on my data as well as stories that 
I heard in the research process, opened my eyes to how inequities related to 
health are magnified during a crisis, and sheltering in place does not inflict equivalent 
hardship on all people. With the data presented in this project, the message I 
hope you take away is that there is still so much work to be done to ensure that people 
who experience abuse can continue to obtain access to support, refuge, and medical care 
when another public health disaster hits. Additionally, as local city and state mandates begin
to ease and people begin to return to their normal routines, public health officials
and policy makers must continue addressing the social inequities within our 
communities as well as making healthcare more accessible to all people. 
With this this in mind, I attempt to answer the following question: How has COVID-19 affected domestic dispute 
cases in US Cities?
